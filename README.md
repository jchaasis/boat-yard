This app was our first collaborative project between and front-end and back-end student. The goal of the project was to build Lotbot, a parking lot management app. My partner and I twisted it a little bit to make it a marina management app instead.  It was a little difficult at first to figure out the information we wanted to store and figuring out how the two ends should communicate, but once we hashed out our plan it grew into a fun project.
